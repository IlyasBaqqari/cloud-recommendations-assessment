# CLOUD RECOMMENDATIONS COMPUTATIONAL NOTEBOOK ASSESSMENT INSTRUCTIONS

This assessment requires to you create a computational notebook containing advice on cloud computing.

In essence you are writing a report on cloud computing for an organisation which currently has on-premise computing but are considering adopting cloud computing technology.  

Submit your notebook (.ipynb and any image files) via GCULearn by the date indicated in the submission link.

Make sure that you ‘run’ the final version of your notebook before submission.

Please note the plagiarism and late submission policy - https://www.gcu.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/37313/university20assessment20regulations20ug2021-2220final.pdf

Further information including the marking scheme is given below.

## INTRODUCTION - 100 WORDS APPROXIMATELY

Choose a case study type from;
•	Streaming services
•	Online gaming
•	Work based – to be agreed with Module Leader

Devise an organisation and write an outline which includes; a name, a brief description about what they do and a few requirements they have that could be met using cloud computing.  

In this section you should also provide an explanation of the key issues in cloud computing that are relevant to your organisation making use of the module materials.
 
## CLOUD RECOMENDATIONS - 200 WORDS APPROXIMATELY

In this section you should state your Cloud Recommendations for each of the following topics explaining ‘what is your recommendation’ and ‘why it fits’ your organisation; 
•	cloud service model 
•	cloud deployment model types
•	cloud pattern(s)
•	cloud services 

You should make use of module materials and not simply google the terms because different sources vary in the use of some of these terms.

## DATA ANALYTICS - 200 WORDS APPROXIMATELY

Explain how data visualisations and data analysis could be used to benefit your organisation.  Illustrate your explanation using images of your data visualisations. 

You should be clear about ‘what is the data’ and ‘why visualisations and analytics fit’ your organisation.

## NOTEBOOK

Your computational notebook should exemplify good use of markdown and appropriate use of python code.

|A|The introduction is excellent with a choice of organization, outlined in detail and related to cloud computing.  Excellent explanation of key issues in cloud computing making extensive use of the module materials.|7|Excellent choices across all topics and highly relevant to the organization.  The ‘what’ explanations are comprehensive and the ‘why fits’ explanations are insightful.|31|Excellent explanation of the use of DV & DA, with insightful use of the data and explanation of why data analytics is useful to the organisation.|30|Excellent use of markdown and python code. Insightful use that fits the org.|7|
|B|The introduction is very good with a choice of organization, an outline firmly related to cloud computing.  The explanation of key issues makes use of several points from the module materials.|6|Very good choices across all topics and relevant to the organization.  The ‘what’ explanations are accurate and the ‘why fits’ explanations are relevant.   	|27|	Very good explanation of the use of DV & DA, with thoughtful use of the data and explanation of why data analytics is useful to the organisation.	|26|	Very good use of markdown and python code. A thoughtful use that fits the org.	|6|
|C|	The introduction is moderately good with a choice of organization, an outline generally related to cloud computing.  The explanation of key issues makes limited but clear use of the module materials.|	5|	Moderately good choices across all topics and mostly relevant to the organization.  The ‘what’ explanations are inconsistent and the ‘why fits’ explanations are general to most organizations.   |	23|	Moderately good explanation of the use of DV & DA, with reasonable use of the data and explanation of why data analytics is useful to the organisation.	|22|	Moderately good use of markdown and python code. A reasonable use that fits the org.	|5|
|D|	The introduction is satisfactory with a choice of organization, but with little outline relating to cloud computing.  The explanation of key issues is brief and/or does not make use of the module materials.	|4|	Satisfactory choices across all topics and somewhat relevant to the organization.  The ‘what’ explanations are basic and the ‘why fits’ explanations are unclear at times and/or general.   	|19|	Satisfactory explanation of the use of DV & DA, with general comments on the use of the data and explanation of why data analytics is useful to the organisation.	|18|	Satisfactory use of markdown and python code.  A general use that fits the org.	|4|
